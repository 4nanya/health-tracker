**Palo Alto Networks Intern Challenge - Option 3** 
For my case study, I chose Option 3: Personal Health Data Aggregator. This project takes 2 distinct datasets whose data doesn't necessarily match. It merges them into 1 dataset on their date -- after making them both UTC. Further analysis of the data can then be done to learn more about how someone sleeps/works out.
